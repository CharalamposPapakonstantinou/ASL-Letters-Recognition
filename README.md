# ASL Letters Recognition using Random Forest Classifier 

Required: CV2, Pandas, Mediapipe, Numpy

The code is structured in three sections:
  
  The first is used to derive the training/test data. (The existing data can already be used for training the RFC).
  
  The second is referring to the RFC model (Training and Confusion Matrix Visualization).
  
  The third is used for capturing frames from the webcam and making the prediction for each gesture.

## RUN
To run the code in MacOS you will probably need to run throught terminal or run pycharm through anaconda in order to have access to the webcam.
